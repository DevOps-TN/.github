## DevOps Tunis

This Organization is used to document your journey on getting a better foundational knowledge of "DevOps".

This project started on the 15 sep 2022.

As we are now into 2023 you can see we have continued the effort and the learning in public where we focus around security and namely DevSecOps.

The goal is to take this cours, 1 hour each a day, to tackle over 13 areas of "DevOps" to a foundational knowledge.

This will not cover all things "DevOps" but it will cover the areas that will benefit your learning and understanding overall.
